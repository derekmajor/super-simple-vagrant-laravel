super-simple-vagrant-laravel
============================

A super simple Vagrant config for Laravel

This is just a really basic Vagrant config that doesn't require Puppet or Chef.

For Ubuntu 12.04. Created for Laravel development, but could be used for other stuff as well.

###Requirements
- VirtualBox
- Vagrant 


###Acknowledgements
I originally combined a little code from two other Vagrant/Laravel repos:

- https://github.com/bryannielsen/Laravel4-Vagrant
- https://github.com/duellsy/Laravel-4-Vagrant
